This error occurs when using Expo CLI with a project that uses a custom Babel configuration.  The Expo CLI might conflict with the custom configuration, leading to unexpected build errors or the build process failing altogether. The error messages may vary depending on the specific conflict but often involve issues with plugins or presets not being recognized or handled correctly by Expo.
